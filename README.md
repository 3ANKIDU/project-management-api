# Project Management API

Welcome to the Project Management API! This is a backend API built with Laravel to help manage projects, tasks, and teams. It provides the necessary endpoints for managing projects, assigning tasks to team members, and tracking progress in a structured and scalable way.

This project is **private** and is intended to be used only after obtaining confirmation from the project owner (you). It is designed to serve as a personal or reference tool, and not for public use without explicit permission.

## Features (Planned)

### Core Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and management with roles and permissions.
- **Project Management**: Create, update, and delete projects with details like title, description, and due dates.
- **Task Management**: Create tasks within projects, assign them to team members, set priorities, and track completion status.
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable team members to comment on tasks and attach files.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track task completion and overall project progress.
- **Deadlines & Notifications**: Set deadlines for tasks and receive notifications for task assignments or approaching due dates.

### Advanced Features (Coming Soon):
- **Time Tracking**: Log the time spent on tasks.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Generate reports on task completion, project timelines, and team performance.
- **Search & Filters**: Easily search and filter tasks and projects.
- **API Rate Limiting & Security**: Rate-limiting for API requests, ensuring system stability and security.
- **Data Export**: Export project/task data to CSV or PDF format.

## Installation

To get started with this API, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (version 8.1 or above)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs) (Latest version)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or any compatible database

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3ANKIDU/project-management-api.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   cd project-management-api
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up the Environment File**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Generate the Application Key**

   Laravel requires an application key for encryption. You can generate it by running the following command:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Set Up Database**

   Make sure you have a database ready, and configure your `.env` file with the correct database credentials. For example:
   ```
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=project_management
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```

6. **Migrate the Database**

   Run the migrations to set up the necessary tables:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**

   You can now run the Laravel development server to start the API:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

Once the API is up and running, you can interact with the endpoints using an API client like **Postman** or **Insomnia**. Here’s a list of the currently available (and planned) endpoints:

- **Authentication**
  - `POST /api/register` — Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/login` — Log in and receive a bearer token for authentication.

- **Projects**
  - `GET /api/projects` — Retrieve all projects.
  - `POST /api/projects` — Create a new project.
  - `GET /api/projects/{id}` — Get a specific project.
  - `PUT /api/projects/{id}` — Update a project.
  - `DELETE /api/projects/{id}` — Delete a project.

- **Tasks**
  - `GET /api/projects/{id}/tasks` — Retrieve all tasks for a project.
  - `POST /api/projects/{id}/tasks` — Create a new task within a project.
  - `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` — Update a task.
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` — Delete a task.
